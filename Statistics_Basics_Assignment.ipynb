        "1. **Covariance (37.50):**\n",
        "   - A **positive covariance** of 37.50 indicates that there is a **positive relationship** between hours studied and scores achieved.\n",
        "   - As the number of hours studied increases, the scores achieved tend to increase as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Correlation (1.00):**\n",
        "   - The **correlation of 1.00** indicates a **perfect positive linear relationship** between the hours studied and the scores achieved. This means that for every additional hour studied, the score increases in a predictable, linear manner.\n",

        "## **Conclusion:**\n",
        "- **Covariance** gives a raw measure of the relationship between two variables, but it’s not easy to interpret in isolation because its value depends on the units of the variables.\n",
        "- **Correlation** normalizes the covariance to a range between **-1 and 1**, making it easier to interpret. A correlation of 1.0 indicates a perfect positive relationship, as we observed here.\n",
